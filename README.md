# cueball

## About

`cueball` is a library for "playing pool" -- managing a pool of connections to a
multi-node service. Information about the available service nodes to connect to
is provided by implementors of the `Resolver` trait.

This is currently a WIP rust implementation of Joyent's
[`node-cueball`](https://github.com/joyent/node-cueball) library. It is under
development and is not ready for use yet.
