# cueball

## About

A multi-node service connection pool

Cueball is a library for "playing pool" -- managing a pool of connections to
a multi-node service. This implementation of cueball is inspired by the
original Node.js implementation of
[cueball](https://joyent.github.io/node-cueball/) that is used by many of
Joyent's services and software components. The rust implementation relies on
two primary traits in order to manage a set of connections across a set
nodes providing a service. These are the
`Resolver` trait and the
`Connection` trait.

### Resolvers

A *resolver* is responsible for locating all of the nodes or backends
available within a logical service, obtaining their IP address and port
information (or whatever is required to connect to them) and tracking
them. This is normally a service discovery client of some form. An example
of this would be a DNS-based Resolver implementation that uses DNS SRV
records as a form of service discovery mechanism to find backends.

### Connections

In cueball, a *connection* is not necessarily just a TCP socket. It can be
anything that provides some kind of logical connection to a service, as long
as it obeys a similar interface to a socket.

This is intended to allow users of the API to represent a "connection" as an
application or session layer concept. For example, it could be useful to
construct a pool of connections to an LDAP server that perform a bind
operation (authenticate) before they are considered *connected*.

In addition to a `Resolver` and
`Connection` implementation cueball
users also provide the cueball connection pool with a function to establish
a *connection* to the desired service. The trait bounds established by the
cueball connection pool for this function are as follows:
```rust.ignore
FnMut(&Backend) -> C + Send + 'static
where C: Connection
```
The requirement is a function that takes a reference to a
`Backend` from a resolver and returns some
instance of a `Connection`.

The purpose of this function is to provide a way to capture application
level configuration information required to establish a *connection* to a
service. *e.g.* A database connection might require application-specific
configuration such as a database name or user name in order to establish a
connection.

### Rebalancing

As `Backend`s for a service come and go the
connection pool rebalances the configured number of connections
(`max_connections`) across the available set of
`Backend`s. Rebalancing occurs when a
`Resolver` notifies the connection pool that
a new backend has been added or that an existing backend has been
removed. The connection pool rebalances the connections in response to one
of these events in order to maintain an even distribution of the connections
among the available backends.

The connection pool uses a configurable delay when a message is received
from the `Resolver` prior to performing the
actual rebalancing. This delay is to account for situations where multiple
messages might be sent by the `Resolver` in
a very short span of time and allows the connection pool to be more
efficient in rebalancing the connections. The default rebalancing delay time
is 100 milliseconds.

Rebalancing can cause the connection pool to temporarily exceed the maximum
number of connections configured for the pool. If the
`Resolver` notifies the connection pool that
a backend is removed, but connections for that backend are still in use the
connection count may exceed the maximum until those connections are returned
to the connection pool and discarded.

### Decoherence

Decoherence in cueball is used to mean a periodic random shuffling of the order
of connections in the connection pool. The goal of decoherence is to avoid
undesirable patterns that could emerge in the lifetime of the connection
pool. For example suppose that a service has three backends, `A`, `B`, and
`C` and the connection pool has a maximum connection count of nine. The
initial connection distribution might look as follows:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | B | C | A | B | C | A | B | C |

The cueball connection pool uses a queue internally to store the
connections. Given that connections from the pool may be claimed for
nonuniform periods of time it is possible that the queue could arrive at the
following state from its initial state:

| 1 | 4 | 7 | 2 | 5 | 8 | 3 | 6 | 9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | A | A | B | B | B | C | C | C |

This situation is not ideal because the same backend must handle multiple
consecutive requests while the other backends are idle. The ideal for
cueball is to have an even distribution of work among the backends not just
with respect to connection count, but also with respect to to request
distribution over time. Now admittedly the above example is an extreme
case and the pattern could quickly resolve itself based on the workload, but
there is no guarantee that would be the case. The goal of the periodic
decoherence shuffle in cueball is to disrupt these sorts of patterns that
might arise and persist for an extended period.

There is one configuration option related to decoherence:
`decoherence_interval`. The `decoherence_interval`
represents the length of the period of the decoherence shuffle in seconds. If no
value is specified for this in the `ConnectionPoolOptions` struct the default
value is 300 seconds.

### Example

Use of cueball for connection management requires both an implementation of
the `Resolver` trait and an implementation
of the `Connection` trait. Implementers
of the `Resolver` trait provide information
to the connection pool about the nodes availble to provide a given
service. The `Connection` trait defines
a behavior for establishing and closing a *connection* to a particular
service.

Here is an example that uses a hypothetical
`Resolver` and
`Connection` implementation to create a
cueball connection pool.

```rust,ignore
use std::thread;
use std::net::{IpAddr, Ipv4Addr, SocketAddr};
use std::sync::{Arc, Barrier, Mutex};
use std::sync::mpsc::Sender;
use std::{thread, time};

use slog::{Drain, Logger, info, o};

use cueball::backend;
use cueball::backend::{Backend, BackendAddress, BackendPort};
use cueball::connection::Connection;
use cueball::connection_pool::ConnectionPool;
use cueball::connection_pool::types::ConnectionPoolOptions;
use cueball::error::Error;
use cueball::resolver::{BackendAddedMsg, BackendMsg, Resolver};

fn main() {
    let plain = slog_term::PlainSyncDecorator::new(std::io::stdout());
    let log = Logger::root(
        Mutex::new(
            slog_term::FullFormat::new(plain).build()
        ).fuse(),
        o!("build-id" => "0.1.0")
    );

    let be1 = (IpAddr::V4(Ipv4Addr::new(127, 0, 0, 1)), 55555);
    let be2 = (IpAddr::V4(Ipv4Addr::new(127, 0, 0, 1)), 55556);
    let be3 = (IpAddr::V4(Ipv4Addr::new(127, 0, 0, 1)), 55557);

    let resolver = FakeResolver::new(vec![be1, be2, be3]);

    let pool_opts = ConnectionPoolOptions::<FakeResolver> {
        max_connections: 15,
        claim_timeout: Some(1000)
        resolver: resolver,
        log: log.clone(),
        decoherence_interval: None,
    };

    let pool = ConnectionPool::<DummyConnection, FakeResolver>::new(pool_opts);

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let pool = pool.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let conn = pool.claim()?;
            // Do stuff here
            // The connection is returned to the pool when it falls out of scope.
        })
    }
}
```
